# AntClimNow Ocean ACI

This repository contains the python scripts to calculate following oceanic Antarctic Climate Indicators (ACI):
1. Barotropic Ross Gyre transport [Sv]
2. Barotropic Weddell Gyre transport [Sv]
3. Barotropic Drake Passage transport [Sv]
4. Antarctic Bottom Water volume [km^3]
5. Antartcic Bottom Water temperature [degrees C] (potential temperature)
6. Antarctic Bottom Water salinity [psu]
7. High Salinity Shelf Water Ross Sea volume [km^3]
8. High Salinity Shelf Water Ross Sea temperature [degrees C] (potential temperature)
9. High Salinity Shelf Water Ross Sea salinity [psu]
10. High Salinity Shelf Water Weddell Sea volume [km^3]
11. High Salinity Shelf Water Weddell Sea temperature [degrees C] (potential temperature)
12. High Salinity Shelf Water Weddell Sea salinity [psu]
13. Antarctic Bottom water export northwar across 35S [Sv]
14. Strength of the Bottom water overturning cell [Sv]

Monthly means of this diagnostics are provide in AntClimNow_Ocean_ACI_v1.csv for the period 1960 to 2023.
Data originates from ORAS5 reanalysis datasets. (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-oras5?tab=form)
